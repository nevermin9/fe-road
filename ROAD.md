# The FE Road

## Rules
1. Look ups only in English. Google in English. Spec & doc in English.

2. It is better to start getting used to UNIX systems.  
__What is UNIX?__  
- It is a multi-user system where the same resources can be shared by different users.
- It provides multi-tasking, wherein each user can execute many processes at the same time.
- It was the first operating system that was written in a high-level language (C Language). This made it easy to port to other machines with minimum adaptations.
- It provides a hierarchical file structure that allows easier access and maintenance of data.
- Unix has built-in networking functions so that different users can easily exchange information.
- Unix functionality can be extended through user programs built on a standard programming interface.

__Why UNIX system?__  
- Open Source
- It is free
- Easier to install/replace software package/library.
- Easier to rollback installed version of software package/library.
- If your software development requires a specific version of library, you almost always have a trivial option to compile it from sources with your own flags and configuration.
- Filesystem structure makes much more sense compared to Windows.
- Basic and free compilers and build tools available in all distributions.
- You have more choices of window managers / desktop managers - easier to build optimal development environments.  
- Configuration of most Linux components is basically editing text based configuration files - it's easier to automate processes like that as you can generate such files easily.
- In most cases your tools will just load and run faster Linux, gain more performance from machine.
Linux and other modern UNIX based systems where developed with network in mind, they where built in early 90's with very strong support for the internet and internet servers.
- Basic system debugging in Linux is trivial, for advance features tools like dtrace and strace are available.

Basically UNIX like OS gives developers more control over the entire system they develop for/on, also includes systems like FreeBSD or hurd. UNIX systems can give developers 100% stability if they know to tame it.


__What UNIX system should I choose?__  
IMO, the best choice for beginners is [Ubuntu Linux](https://ubuntu.com/) LTS version.

3. Editor for code 
IMO, the best choice for beginners is [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

4. Recommended to have fast fingers) It is not necessarily, but it is better to have such a skill  
[Here you can practice](https://www.typingclub.com/)

5. Practice, practice and practice again! Make questions, google, try different options of code in editor, explore and create!

## Road
1. What is HTML, CSS and JavaScript and how they are used?
2. [HTML Course]( https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html )
3. [CSS Course 1](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css)
3. [CSS Course 2](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-intermediate-css)
4. [Responsive CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-responsive-design)
5. On this step you should create the responsive copy of some page (e.g, gmail, facebook, twitter)
6. Read "Vital topics for FE" (below)
7. [Good book to learn JS](https://learn.javascript.ru/). Resolve all problems at the end of every chapter.
9. After 8.4 chapter of the book above, I recommend to sign up here [GitHub](https://github.com/) and via this account sign up here [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) and start resolving problem. 3-5 problems per day.
10. Finish "Part 2. JavaScript language", "Part 2. Browser: document, events, interfaces", "Network requests", "Storing data in the browser", "Regular expressions"
11. Add JavaScript to your copy (p. 5 on the list). Add sign up form, validation, store user data in localstorage, request data from free api server, show some lists of data on your website. There will be a lot of work !)
12. As a nice skill, lear a command line [on the codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line). As you wish )
